        <p> This is a server created for the react app todo.<br>
            It is made with Nodejs and the data are avaiable at the page /todoData.html<br>
            <br>I tried to not hard code only one type of data/status, so in the future more
            type of data can be displayed in different pages using the same server.
            <br>
            Pretty sure this is not the best way to do things, but for the purpose of learning
            I think it is not a complete failure.
            <br><br> This server responde at GET, POST, PUT and DELETE
        </p>
